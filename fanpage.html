      <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>Flamingosis (the name comes from a free-style frisbee move that his father invented) is a New Jersey-based electronic music producer, beatboxer, and DJ. Drawing on influences from producers such as FLYING LOTUS and J DILLA as well as vintage funk and disco music, Flamingosis creates engaging and soulful tracks and puts on a infectiously energetic live show.
